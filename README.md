In Fall 2023 I completed a semester of MA Computational Linguistics at Goldsmiths University London. Although I unfortunately had to withdraw from the program due to Life Stuff™️, I'm continuing to learn and explore the subject through reading, online courses, and personal experiments. 

Things I'm particularly interested in exploring: 
* Using Natural Language Processing to analyze tone and sentiment in media, academic literature and public policy to understand attitudes and narratives around social issues, with a view to identifying possible solutions. For example, by studying narratives about homelessness, what can we learn about the biases and misconceptions that people have about unhoused people and housing crises happening around the world? How can we use this insight to educate, and explore new solutions?
* Improving how voice recognition software (dictation, voice assistants, etc) recognizes and processes non-standard speech (different accents, speech disorders, regional or ethnic variants of English)
